# THIS IS A TEST DO NOT MERGE
# Spartan

No syntax highlighting?!? This is madness!

THIS IS SPARTA!!!!

## Why

When analyzing the color schemes that I have been using for ages, I began to
question what value the different colors were adding to my daily coding
activities. The answer I arrived that was nothing. Sparta is my attempt at
providing only the necessary coloring. Spartan is simple, frugal and highly
effective.
